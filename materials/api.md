## Tasks

- Develop API client

## RESTful

Before diving into the API that our app will use, please read about [REST API](https://restfulapi.net).

## The Movie Database (TMDb)

In this task you will work with [Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

In the previous task, you already have a screen with Movies, so now it's time to connect it with real API.

Step by step:

- Read this [Article](https://kean.blog/post/api-client#client) about how to create RESTful api client
- Find in API documentation how to get movies by category, you need to get `new`, `popular`, `trending` movies.
- Implement requests
- Connect your api with your movie screen
